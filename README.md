# museum_streamlit
The goal of this project is to perform topic modeling on artwork descriptions from various museums and then by using KMeans clustering provide recommendations / similiar artworks based on the artwork description, medium, and year it was created. The museums that were scraped are the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Harvard Art Museum, Cleveland Art Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago. APIâ€™s were used to grab more information about the artwork as well.

This project aims to provide a recommendation system for art enthusiasts to find similar artworks across multiple museums.
