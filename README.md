This project explores the power of unstructured data through topic modeling and clustering techniques to build a recommendation system for artworks across multiple museums. By analyzing artwork data and descriptions, this streamlit app helps users discover similar pieces from different collections.
## Project Goal
To recommend similar artworks based on shared featuresâ€”such as description, medium, and year of creation to encourage exploration across diverse museum collections.


## Museums Included
- Metropolitan Museum of Art
- Harvard Art Museum
- Cleveland Museum of Art
- Art Institute of Chicago
- National Gallery of Art


## Methods & Tools
- Topic Modeling (to identify descriptive themes)
- KMeans Clustering (to group similar artworks)
- Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup (for data extraction)
- Public APIs (to retrieve artwork metadata)
- Streamlit (to build an interactive user-facing app)
- Pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK/SpaCy (for text processing and ML)
